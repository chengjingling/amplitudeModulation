# Amplitude Modulation

## About

Amplitude modulation is a common method of audio steganography consisting of moving a secret message to an ultrasonic range of frequencies, then mixing it with that of an audio file. This application aims to reverse the operation on three audio files (Ex3_sound2.wav, Ex3_sound3.wav and Ex3_sound4.wav) and determine which one contains a four-number secret code.
